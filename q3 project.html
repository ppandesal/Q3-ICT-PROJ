        <h2>What Does Fire Prevention Mean?</h2>
        <br>
<p>
Fire prevention relates to the goal of educating members of workplaces and the public in taking proactive steps to prevent fires from starting and to reduce the harmful impact of fires.
<br>

		<h2>Safeopedia Explains Fire Prevention</h2>

While fire prevention is the primary task of fire departments, many departments have a Fire Prevention Officer who is tasked with educating the community regarding fire safety. The Fire Prevention Division conducts building inspections to make sure they are compliant with safety codes.</p>

			<td>House fires may very well be triggered if your home heating sources are not working properly. Be sure to always clean out your air conditioning filters, keep your heaters away from anything that is flammable, and have these things checked out by a professional once a year.

The continuous electricity that’s flowing into them provides them with a source for a fire as well. By unplugging these items when you’re not using them and, therefore, not paying attention to them, you can cut down on your chances of a fire.</td>

			<td><br>It only takes a few seconds for a fire to break out. If you need to leave the kitchen for any reason whatsoever, make sure to either ask someone to watch the food for you or turn everything off altogether until you’re back.

The surge protector keeps that extra out and can definitely reduce your risk of having a fire in the first place or the strength of it if you do get one.</td>

				Flammable items like fabrics, paper, and even hair should always be kept away from excessive heat or flame. You want to keep your hair and your clothes out of the way when you’re starting a fire in your fireplace.</td>

			<td>Before you plug something into a socket, try to be courteous in ensuring that the wire hasn’t been torn or chewed up (in case you have any pets running around). Damaged wires can be a detrimental fire hazard and need replacing as soon as possible. Also, remember that wires do get hot when in use, so be sure to check your wire placement and avoiding passing them under a carpet or anywhere that could potentially catch fire.
